# About

This repository was created to practice different functions in JS.

### Task 1 - Gallery:

This code generates a dynamic gallery of images on a webpage using an imported array of gallery items. It creates a thumbnail preview and description for each image, and when an image is clicked, a modal window opens that displays the full-sized image. 

### Task 2 - Video:

This code sets up a Vimeo player on a webpage and listens for the "timeupdate" event to save the current time of the video to the browser's localStorage. The saved current time is retrieved and set as the current time of the player when the page is loaded. If there is no saved time, the player starts from the beginning.


## Libraries
- Vimeo-player
